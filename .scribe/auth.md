# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_AUTH_KEY}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

You can retrieve your token by loggin into a free account in the NORMAN DATABASE SYSTEM enviroment and generate an API token in you dashboard.
