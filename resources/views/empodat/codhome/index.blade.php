          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            To include data into the NORMAN Database, DATA COLLECTION TEMPLATES (DCT) in Excel were developed for each matrix. These DCTs can be downloaded at 
            <a href="https://www.norman-network.com/nds/empodat/downloadDCT.php" class="link-lime-text">
              https://www.norman-network.com/nds/empodat/downloadDCT.php
            </a>.

          <!-- Contact Information -->
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The completed DCTs should be sent to the NORMAN Database development team: 
            <a href="mailto:norman@ei.sk" class="link-lime-text">norman@ei.sk</a> with a copy to 
            <a href="mailto:slobodnik@ei.sk" class="link-lime-text">slobodnik@ei.sk</a>, for further processing and upload to the web-database.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Large datasets, available in other than Excel format, can be uploaded as well, after communication with the NORMAN team â€“ to check the structure of data, availability of obligatory information, and to agree on the optimal way of the data transfer.
