          <!-- Description -->
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Since the outbreak of the Covid19 pandemic, wastewater research groups around the world have collecting influent wastewater samples to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA. This time-critical activity is particularly challenging as many laboratories are still lock-down, reagents in short supply and, with no standard sampling protocol, analytical method or quality assurance/quality control procedures, samples are currently collected and analysed for viral RNA using a variety of methodologies. One approach to reducing uncertainty in developing national and international data sets is to develop a common protocol for sample collection, storage, extraction, analysis and data sharing which research groups can opt to use as – or alongside – their own protocols to support the development of an international comparable data set.          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This voluntary initiative - developed as an opportunity for researchers to contribute to international efforts to tackle the Covid19 pandemic - is open to all and self-funded (i.e. at laboratories own cost).
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Results submitted using the reporting template will be stored within the NORMAN database system (open access).
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
