The third Joint Danube Survey (JDS3), which took place in 2013, provided the largest ever amount of knowledge about the Danube water pollution collected within a single scientific exercise. It reconfirmed that the Danube flora and fauna show a high degree of biodiversity. During JDS3, the depth of information on hydromorphological conditions was significantly improved, as in-situ measurements of hydrological, morphological and hydraulic characteristics were performed for the first time along the entire Danube and its tributaries. The first complex testing of antibiotic resistance was carried out along the entire stretch of the Danube River. Several new analytical techniques and strategies were applied targeting hundreds of organic substances, resulting in the most comprehensive information ever acquired on this topic for the Danube River. The analysis of such a large amount of organic substances enabled the first suggestions for the update and prioritization of Danube River Basin Specific Pollutants.","<li>V.

5,JDS4,"The key purpose of Joint Danube Surveys (JDS) is to produce reliable and comparable information on carefully selected elements of water quality for the length of the Danube River, including its major tributaries. Three Joint Danube Surveys have previously been conducted, in 2001, 2007, and 2013. The fourth of its kind, JDS4 was launched in June 2019 at sampling sites in 13 countries across the Danube River Basin. With the view to obtaining a complex picture of the water quality in the Danube and its major tributaries, the yearly assessment of water quality published in TNMN Yearbooks has been supplemented by periodic investigative surveys, which are carried out every six years in sync with the river basin management planning period according to the EU WFD. JDS4 was a milestone in the series of Joint Danube Surveys. The three past Surveys were based on a principle that a Core Team of leading experts did all the sampling and, in case of biology, microbiology and hydromorphology, analysis of samples too, while the national experts joined the Core Team only when in their respective country and mostly observed how the work was done (sometimes they provided assistance to the Core Team). JDS4 was organized the other way round: a significant part of the job during the survey (biology, hydromorphology, physico-chemical analyses) was accomplished by the national experts while 
the Core Team had a coordinating and advisory role to ensure coherence between the approaches used by the national experts. This approach, along with training workshops for each biological quality element organized prior to the survey, provided an excellent opportunity for harmonization and training in WFD- related monitoring giving this way the above-mentioned long-term key objective of JDS a prominent place.<br>
The sampling for analysis and screening of chemical pollutants and of environmental DNA was performed by special monitoring teams. JDS4 was organized on the Danube River including its major tributaries, with a sampling program focused on 51 sites nominated by the ICPDR experts. ","<li>I. Liška, F. Wagner, M. Sengl, K.

6,EMBLAS,"EMBLAS was designed to tackle deficiencies and limitations in availability of accurate reliable and comparable marine data, as well as to build capacities of the countries to perform integrated environmental monitoring and assessment of the Black Sea according to the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD), EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) for the coastal zones and the needs of the Black Sea Strategic Action Plan (BS SAP). The aim of the project was to determine degree of contamination and the effects of pollution by hazardous substances in the Black Sea, mainly its Eastern (Georgian area) and Western (Ukrainian area) sides. An in-depth contamination survey was carried out based on the profiling of WFD priority substances (2013/39/EC) and the screening of potential Black Sea Specific Pollutants in different environmental compartments (seawater and sediments) and marine organisms (mussels and fish). Several analytical methods and novel techniques were applied for the analysis of the samples. Target, suspect and non-target screening approaches were followed for the detection of priority pollutants and emerging contaminants, while advanced software and sophisticated tools were used for results’ extraction and toxicity prediction. Moreover, the risk of the identified emerging contaminants on the aquatic environment was evaluated following the EU risk assessment quidelines (Directive 93/67/EEC, 1488/94/EC, Directive 98/8/EC). The overall objective of the project was to set up initiatives that will help improve the protection of the Black Sea environment. The project was  addressing the overall need for support in protection and restoring the environmental quality and sustainability of the Black Sea. The specific objectives were as follows: i) Improve availability and quality of data on the chemical and biological status of the Black Sea, in line with expected MSFD and Black Sea Strategic Action Plan needs; ii) Improve partner countries' ability to perform marine environmental monitoring along MSFD principles, taking into account the Black Sea Diagnostic Report (http://www.blacksea-commission.org/_publBSDiagnosticReport2010.asp).

The EU4EMBLAS project is implemented by UNDP Istanbul Regional Hub. The project was building on the results of previous project phases and complements the needs to build further the national capacities – technical and personal, to implement marine environment monitoring programmes, in line with the Bucharest Convention and EU reporting requirements. The-art analytical methodologies have been applied allowing for screening of several thousands of organic pollutants and their transformation products (TPs) by wide-scope target (>2,400 substances) and suspect (>95,000 substances). Samples for analysis of microplastics in seawater and sediments by several sampling techniques, seawater samples for analysis of antimicrobial resistance and fish environmental DNA, were collected. The Cruise of Three European Seas took place in the period from 1 to 21 October 2021. The transfer of RV Belgica was organized and funded by the EU/UNDP project «European Union for Improving Environmental Monitoring of the Black Sea» (EU4EMBLAS).

13,Montenegro,"The project ‘Strengthening the Capacities for Implementation of the Water Framework Directive in Montenegro’,a detailed monitoring programme of water bodies in Montenegro was realised in the period 2019–2021. The purpose of theos activity was to increase the methodological knowledge and capacity of experts in Montenegro so that they were able to comply with the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD, and therefore provided them with the capacity to carry out WFD-compliant monitoring programme in the future. The Training Module and its sampling programme covered two major river basins and their main tributaries, namely the Danube River Basin (rivers Piva, Tara, Ćehotina and Lim) and the Adriatic Sea Basin (rivers Zeta, Morača, Bojana and the coastal zone). The sampling campaign took place on 15 pre-selected sampling locations from 2 to 8 July 2018. On-site investigations and sampling of surface water, sediments and biota were carried out by a team of project experts accompanied with experts from Montenegro institutions including IHMS, CETI, IMB and University of Montenegro. The main goals of the baseline chemical survey were to demonstrate WFD-compliant:
<ul>
<li>Monitoring of general chemical and physico-chemical quality elements supporting assessment of the ecological status based on Biological Quality Elements (BQEs).</li>
<li>Analysis of WFD priority substances (PS) as defined in the Environmental Quality Standards Directive (EQSD, [2]) taking into account QA/QC Directive [3] to determine chemical status.</li>
<li>Wide-scope screening of chemical pollutants as a basis for identification of Montenegro River Basin Specific Pollutants (RBSPs; WFD) with the aim of setting up their EQS and follow up monitoring to assess ecological status.</li>

14,Antarctica,"The wide-scope target and non-target screening of biota samples are very effective ways, since pollutants present in biota are highly probably bio-accumulative (B) and persistent (P), and thus fulfilling two out of three PBT criteria considered under REACH legislation. As a means of prioritising the most ubiquitous pollutants at the global scale there is a need to look at their occurrence in remote areas, including the Arctic region and Antarctica. It is expected that with global warming the polar areas will become more accessible and, thus, more polluted from anthropogenic activities. Two batches of samples (Tier I and Tier II) from Antarctica region were collected and analyzed, including different biota species. Tier I - included four biota samples, Tier II samples  included ten biota samples. The samples were screened for priority pollutants and several thousands of chemicals of emerging concern and their transformation products by wide-scope target (ca. 2,100 substances) and suspect screening (>65,000 substances) techniques. The above services are increasingly being recognised by the EU and other marine conventions as being of importance in identifying potential contaminant threats to the aquatic environment. The specific objectives of the study were as follows:
<ol style=""list-style-type: lower-alpha;"">
<li>Analysis of Water Framework Directive heavy metals (lead, cadmium, chrome, nickel and mercury).</li>
<li>Determination of Novel organophosphorus flame retardants and Dechloran Plus.</li>
<li>Analysis of Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (sum of Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDD), Polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) and Dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB-DL)) and Polybrominated diphenyl ethers PBDEs.</li>
<li>A wide-scope target screening analysis of each sample for ca. 2,400 substances by LC-HR-MS (>2,100 emerging pollutants).</li>
<li>Suspect screening of 65,000+ compounds in each of the samples including their semi-quantification using LC-HR-MS.</li>
<li>Upload of the non-target screening chromatograms (both LC-HR-MS and GC-APCI-HR-MS) into NORMAN Digital Sample Freezing Platform (DSFP) for future retrospective screening. A holistic approach was followed for the analysis of WFD priority pollutants and emerging contaminants in samples from the  polar region. A wide-scope target  and suspect screening of 14 biota samples from Antarctica was carried out by LC-HR-MS techniques. The wide-scope target screening comprised analysis of ca, 2,100 substances in each sample, whereas suspect screening provided information on presence/absence of more than 65,000 substances and semi-quantitative estimate of detected substances. Moreover, all acquired LC- and GC- HRMS chromatograms were uploaded to NORMAN Digital Sample Freezing Platform (DSFP).</li>

15,Dniester,"The quality of the Dniester River Basin has been seriously impacted by the chemicals released by agriculture, industry, and wastewater discharges. To assess its current chemical pollution status, a transboundary monitoring campaign was conducted in May 2019. Thirteen surface water, 13 sediment, and three biota samples were collected and analyzed using generic sample preparation methods for the determination of organic substances by liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and metals by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Wide-scope target and suspect screening resulted in detection of Water Framework Directive (WFD) priority substances and emerging contaminants, whereas the raw data were stored in NORMAN Digital Sample Freezing Platform (DSFP) for future retrospective screening. Furthermore, risk assessment was performed to prioritize detected substances and propose a draft list of river basin–specific pollutants. All studied metals (As, Hg, Zn, Cu, Cr, Cd, Pb, Ni) were detected in the surface water and sediments. In total, 139 organic contaminants belonging to various chemical classes (pesticides, pharmaceuticals, drugs of abuse, stimulants, sweeteners, industrial chemicals, and their transformation products) were detected. The highest cumulative concentration of contaminants was observed in surface water from the Byk River, a tributary of the Dniester (Moldova). Concentrations of WFD priority substances diuron and mercury and EU Watch List neonicotinoid compounds imidacloprid and thiamethoxam exceeded their environmental quality standards (EQS), whereas concentrations of 23 emerging substances exceeded their predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) at minimum one site. Emerging contaminants telmisartan, metolachlor, terbuthylazine, and 4-acetamidoantipyrine were prioritized as potential river basin–specific pollutants.","<li>N.A.

16,Siverskyi Donets,"This subproject was established on the request of the OSCE Project Co-ordinator in Ukraine within the project “Assisting the Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources of Ukraine in Improving Environmental Monitoring Mechanisms” that is aimed at strengthening monitoring at the Severskyi Donets river basin in line with water legislation and considering the environmental impacts of the on-going conflict in eastern Ukraine. Severskyi Donets river basin is located on the most industrialized area of the country. A significant part of the river is adjacent to the contact line and is directly affected by the military activities. In addition to the direct impact of military equipment and the use of ammunition, the threat to the environment is posed by accidents, operational disruptions of critical infrastructure facilities, industrial and other enterprises in the region. The investigated part of the Siverskyi Donets River Basin is located on the territory that is controlled by the Government of Ukraine. The purpose of the research is to analyse chemical state of the river basin in line with water standards and monitoring requirements. The sampling was carried out during 24-26 September 2018. 12 water samples (8 surface and 4 ground water), 3 biota, and 9 sediment samples were collected. The main goals of the chemical monitoring were as follows:
<ul>
<li>To assess the chemical status of the Severskyi Donets groundwater water bodies by monitoring quality standards and relevant threshold values.</li>
<li>To assess the chemical status of the Severskyi Donets surface water bodies by analysing 45 WFD priority substances as defined in the Environmental Quality Standards Directive (EQSD 2013/39/EU) in two recommended matrices: water and biota.</li>
<li>Additional analyses of selected metals in water and sediment samples.</li>
<li>Identification of a draft list of Severskyi Donets River Basin Specific Pollutants (RBSPs; WFD 2000/60/EC) in all three investigated matrices by: (i) target screening of specific compounds and (ii) non-target screening (NTS) using a novel tool (DSFP – Digital Sample Freezing Platform) for revealing the presence of suspect and identification of unknown compounds.</li>
